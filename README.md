TangoHelper is a not-so-well written iOS app for reciting Japanese words from the MEANING to the PRONUNCIATION.

* Re-designed Japanese keyboard which has NO prediction (^_^), but ONLY supports Kana (T_T).
* Suitable for Chinese people as usually Kanji is not a problem.
* Metadata like "Last passed" and "Last finished" will be recorded.
* No pre-defined vocabulary. Add your own words and organize them into playlists.
    * However you can use my personal playlists.
    * Simply use the File Sharing function of iTunes and copy files under "My Playlists" directory to the app.

I wrote this app in a strict timeline with a strong will to improve my Japanese skill rapidly,
so that I would be able to chat with Maroni Uno (you could see the name in this codebase),
whom I turned into my girlfriend later.

Since then the development of this app was stopped due to lack of motivation, as well as my Japanese study :(
